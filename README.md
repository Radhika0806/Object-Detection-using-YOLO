# 🚗 Welcome to YOLO-Based Car License Plate Detection!

🌟 A Smart Way to Detect License Plates
Welcome to this exciting project that leverages the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for detecting car license plates in images and videos. Whether you're passionate about computer vision, building smart systems, or simply exploring object detection, this project provides a hands-on and interactive experience.
With an intuitive Streamlit interface, you can easily upload your media files, process them with state-of-the-art YOLO detection, and see the results in real time. Let's dive in and make license plate detection simple, fun, and efficient! 🚀

📂 Project Overview
This application detects car license plates using a fine-tuned YOLO model. It processes user-uploaded images or videos, annotates detected plates with bounding boxes, and displays the confidence scores for each detection.

✨ Key Features
Multiple Media Support:
Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
Videos: .mp4, .mkv
Real-Time Results:
Performs license plate detection and annotation efficiently.
Interactive Interface:
Upload your files, process them, and see the results directly on the app.

🛠️ Technologies Used
YOLO: Pre-trained deep learning model for object detection.
Streamlit: For creating the user-friendly interface.
OpenCV: Image and video processing.
NumPy & PIL: For data handling and image manipulation.
Python: The backbone of this application.
