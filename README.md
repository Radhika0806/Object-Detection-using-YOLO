# 🚗 Welcome to My YOLO-Based Car License Plate Detection Project!

Hi there! 👋
I'm excited to share my latest project, which uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect car license plates in images and videos. This project combines my passion for computer vision and deep learning to create an interactive and real-time license plate detection system.
With a sleek interface built using Streamlit, you can upload your own images or videos and instantly see the detection results, complete with bounding boxes and confidence scores. It's simple, efficient, and a lot of fun to use! 🚀

**📂 About This Project:**

The idea behind this project is to build a system that detects car license plates efficiently, making it useful for real-world applications like traffic monitoring, parking systems, and security. Here’s what it offers:

**✨ Key Features:**

Supports Multiple File Types:
Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .png
Videos: .mp4, .mkv
Real-Time Detection:
Quickly processes your media files to detect license plates.
Annotates detected plates with bounding boxes and detection confidence scores.
Interactive User Interface:
Built with Streamlit, the app makes it easy to upload files and view results right on the screen.

**🛠️ Technologies I Used:**

This project is powered by some amazing tools and libraries:
1. YOLO: The deep learning model I used for object detection.
2. Streamlit: To build the interactive interface.
3. OpenCV: For processing images and videos.
4. NumPy & PIL: For handling image data and manipulations.
5. Python: The backbone of this project! 🐍

**🚀 How You Can Use It:**

Here’s how you can run the project on your own system:

1️⃣ Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Radhika0806/yolo-license-plate-detection.git
cd yolo-license-plate-detection

2️⃣ Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
1. bash
2. Copy code
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Application:

Launch the Streamlit app:
1. bash
2. Copy code
3. streamlit run yolo_application.py

4️⃣ Upload Your Files:

Upload an image or video of a car.
The app will process it, detect license plates, and display the annotated results.

**📸 Sample Outputs**

**💡 Future Plans**

I have some exciting ideas to enhance this project further:
1. Text Extraction with OCR: Automatically extract the license plate number from the detected plates.
2. Live Detection: Enable real-time license plate detection using a webcam or live video feed.
3. Cloud Hosting: Deploy the app to a cloud platform for public access.
